# Lab Directions

First important direction: Create a branch `labs-[yourname]` (e.g. `labs-felix`). Do all your work on this branch!

```shell
git branch labs-[yourname]
git switch labs-[yourname]
```

## Before any lab

Be in the `graphql-labs-server` directory, and run `npm run setup [lab number]` where `[lab number]` is the number of the lab. It should copy over any files needed for setup for this lab.
