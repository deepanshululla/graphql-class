# Add a type for Movie
# Look at data/all-data-typed to see how you would define a Movie
#
# Add a query for movies
# It should not take arguments, but it should return an array of Movies
# Then implement a resolver in resolvers.ts for movies
# Nothing fancy, just return the array of movies from all-data-typed

type Query {
	helloWorld(name: String): String
	movies: [Movie]
}

type Movie {
	title: String
	id: Int!
	year: Int
	rating: Int
